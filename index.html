    <center><h1>Stoicism</h1></center>
    <p>I am currently learning and trying to apply the philosophy of <strong>stoicism</strong> in my life.
    What got me started is <a href="https://dailystoic.com/">daily stoic.</a> Below is Marcus Aurelius, 
    he was a Roman Emperor who ruled from 161 AD until his death in 180 AD. Marcus Aurelius is known 
    for his philosophical writings, particularly his book "Meditations," which he wrote in Greek during his military campaigns. 
    The book is a collection of personal reflections and stoic philosophy, and is considered one of the greatest works of 
    philosophy in the Western tradition.
